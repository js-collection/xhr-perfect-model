<br><br>

## üÜò Before flight:

- Remember to change your api base root the class in place of the [`http://yoursitewithapi:YOURPORTNUMBER/`](https://github.com/js-collection/xhr-perfect-model/blob/development/xhr-classic.js#L2) placeholder.
- Remember to register your api into the class in place of the [`connectors_ENDPOINT_SECTOR`](https://github.com/js-collection/xhr-perfect-model/blob/development/xhr-classic.js#L175) placeholder. You can registre infinite api sectors.
<br><br>

## *Ô∏è‚É£ What it do:

This is the classic model. Someone don't like this because can encurred in a ["callback hell"](https://www.google.com/search?q=what%27s+callback+hell&oq=callback+hell+what&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCAgBEAAYFhgeMgYIABBFGDkyCAgBEAAYFhge0gEIMzY3OGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). If you are that type of dev we suggest the async styled model. In short, it both are the same model but this not need a promise and is stepped and understandable, the async needs of the  async/promise syntax and can be little bit complex respect of this classic version.<br>

You can use all you want into the form, or not use the form with a complete new custom function, it's not important! This asset make a simple class as  preset for a web restful data (text, file or text json) transferts... not else.
<br><br>

## üìë How to:

### Requirements: 

- an endpoint for a restful api 
- suggested a good walkie talkie system 
- in node / express you sure need to able express.text (if you buffering the trasmission) or json+urlencoded (not tested)


### Usage:

- Load class into you web page, like this:
  ```js
  <script src=".../xhr-classic.js"></script>
  ```

- make a form with you data or a function for you API, like:
```html
  <html>
    <form id="test">
        <!--THIS IS A STUPID MODEL, MAKE YOU A CUSTOM DATA-->
        <input multiple="false" name="collector" type="file">
        <input name="test" type="text" placeholder="write every you wont ;)">
        <button name="tester">TEST DATA</button>
    </form>
  </html>
  <script>
    window.onload = () => {
      if (document.readyState == 'complete') {

        //test api and system
        function API_TEST() {

          let form = document.forms[ 'test' ],
              formfiles = form['collector'],
              testnow = form[ 'tester' ]

           testnow.onclick = () => {
               //do operations and call api...
           }

       }

     }
   }
  </script>
```

- use asset to call the class for talk with your api walkie talkie like this:

  ```js
  // set endpoint target profile (it's a demo)

  var profile = { 
      action :'demo-upload-file'
  }
  
  // set endpoint target required parameters

  var params  = {
      file  : formfiles.files[i],
      name  : form['name'].value||formfiles.files[i].name,
      // other : ...
    }
  
  // api call model   

  api.transfer(
    [profile,params],
    progress => console.log("in progress...", progress) ,
    results => console.log("data in back : ",results)
  )
  ```

  How you can easy see, after setted a target in profile and the correct params of your api endpoint, you have 2 callback:
  - progress return the object with progression data sended (an exemple, the bytes and percentage of file sending) and it is called for many times how steps needed for completation (or failing)
  - results is the final data resulted of operations... the payloads, the restful json object of end operations
